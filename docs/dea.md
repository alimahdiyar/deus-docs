## Why have two protocol tokens?

DEUS acts as a Liquidity reserve, it is a proxy of ethereum and thus could not be used for the liquidity mining event. Liquidity mining was meant to encourage users to engage with the DEUS protocol, by letting them farm pre-minted DEA until the launch of the stock trading platform by late January 2021.

DEA was initially conceived as a stablecoin, but this idea was vetoed by the community. Instead, DEA became a low supply coin that has unlimited upside and is the perfect complement to the low price sensitivity of the DEUS token.

A seigniorage stablecoin system will also be developed eventually, but with a different coin serving this role.
